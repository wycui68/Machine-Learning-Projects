**Objective**
Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Language**
Python

**Challenge**
Extreme unbalanced dataset, only 0.172% frauds off all transactions accounted. 

**Model**
Random undersampling and oversampling; dimensionally reduction and clustering (t-SNE); logistic regression; convolutional neural network

**Optimization**
Grid Search; Cross-validation

### Results
Improved accuracy from 84% to 92% by random forest algorithm combined with the grid search.
