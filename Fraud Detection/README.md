Anoymized credict card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine

**Objective**
Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Language**
Python

**Challenge**
Extreme unbalanced dataset, only 0.172% frauds off all transactions accounted. 

**Model**
Random undersampling and oversampling; dimensionally reduction and clustering (t-SNE); logistic regression; 
supported vector machine (SVM); decision tree (DT); convolutional neural network

**Optimization**
Grid Search; Cross-validation

**Results**
Accuracy reached up to 99% by neural network and synthetic minority over-sampling (STOE) technique.
