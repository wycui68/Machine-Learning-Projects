**Title** <br><br>
Anoymized credict card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine

**Objective**<br><br>
Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Language**<br><br>
Python

**Challenge**<br><br>
Extreme unbalanced dataset, only 0.172% frauds off all transactions accounted. 

**Model**<br><br>
Random undersampling and oversampling; dimensionally reduction and clustering (t-SNE); logistic regression; 
supported vector machine (SVM); decision tree (DT); convolutional neural network

**Optimization**<br><br>
Grid Search; Cross-validation

**Results**<br><br>
Accuracy reached up to 99% by neural network and synthetic minority over-sampling (STOE) technique.

The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.
